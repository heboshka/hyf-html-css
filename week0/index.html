    <p class="intro"> Friendly and fun-loving, cultured and historic, Thailand radiates a golden hue, from its glittering temples and tropical beaches through to the ever-comforting Thai smile. With a long coastline (actually, two coastlines) and jungle-topped islands anchored in azure waters, Thailand is a tropical getaway for the hedonist and the hermit, the prince and the pauper.<br> This paradise offers a varied menu: playing in the gentle surf of Ko Lipe, diving with whale sharks off Ko Tao, scaling the sea cliffs of Krabi, kiteboarding in Hua Hin, partying on Ko Phi-Phi, recuperating at a health resort on Ko Samui and feasting on the beach wherever sand meets sea.Adored around the world, Thai cuisine expresses fundamental aspects of Thai culture: it is generous, warm, refreshing and relaxed. Thai dishes rely on fresh, local ingredients – pungent lemongrass, searing chillies and plump seafood.<br> A varied national menu is built around the four fundamental flavours: spicy, sweet, salty and sour.<br>Roving appetites go on eating tours of Bangkok noodle shacks, seafood pavilions in Phuket, and Burmese market stalls in Mae Sot.</p>

        <h2 class="item1">Bangkok:</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Bangkok, official name Krung Thep Maha Nakhon, is the capital of Thailand and, with a population of over eleven million inhabitants, by far its largest city. Its high-rise buildings, heavy traffic congestion, intense heat and naughty nightlife may not immediately give you the best impression — but don't let that mislead you. It is one of Asia's most cosmopolitan cities with magnificent temples and palaces, authentic canals, busy markets and a vibrant nightlife that has something for everyone.

For years, it was only a small trading post at the banks of the Chao Phraya River, until King Rama I, the first monarch of the present Chakri dynasty, turned it into the capital of Siam in 1782, , Bangkok has turned into a national treasure house and functions as Thailand's spiritual, cultural, political, commercial, educational and diplomatic centre.

        <h2 class="item1">Phuket:</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Phuket nestles in balmy Andaman Sea waters on Thailand's Indian Ocean coastline 862 kilometres south of Bangkok. Phuket formerly derived its wealth from tin and rubber, and enjoyed a rich and colourful history. The island was on one of the major trading routes between India and China, and was frequently mentioned in foreign trader’s ship logs.

In recent times, though, Phuket's top earner has been tourism, which has transformed the island into Thailand's wealthiest province. Expect prices to be a bit higher than on the mainland. The west coast of Phuket was hit severely by the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004, but almost no evidence of the damage now remains. Phuket enjoys great popularity as a travel destination. Most beaches are on the west coast, with Phuket Town to the southeast and the airport in the north.<br><strong><em> Where you can go in Phuket:</em></strong>

    <div id="third-p">
      <h2 class="item1">Pattaya</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Pattaya (?????) is a seaside resort on the Eastern Gulf Coast of Thailand, about 150 km southeast of Bangkok. 
Efforts by local authorities over the past few years have improved the quality of the beaches, but they are still lacklustre by Thailand's standards, and over-development has long since destroyed some of the natural charms the area once had. However, the plethora of hotels and guest houses, and easy access from the capital and airport, make it a popular weekend getaway. Catering for over five million annual visitors, Pattaya is also able to offer an excellent range of eating options and a wide variety of things to do. Its population is a colourful mix of nationalities and ethnicities from near and far.</p>
      <h3 id="pid"> Things to do in Pattaya:</h3>
<ol>  
  <li class="pat-li"> Walking Street<br> 
<img class="patt-img" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ_qOoVMPKD4jOcpW5RnEdvXa6P8RRcqQFMZICRgy6Mq9BQAk04" alt="pat-img"> 
     
    <p class="pattaya-p">
     Walking Street Pattaya is the biggest and busiest party hotspot in the whole of Thailand, with only a couple of the top places in Bangkok beating it for sheer volume and variety. A full kilometre from its high-tech gateway at the Beach Road end to the Bali Hai Plaza end. Each of the side streets – which span from Soi 14 to Soi 16, with a couple of uniquely-named streets in between - is more of the same, making the whole southern end of the city into a warren of life entertainments, with something for practically every taste.
    </p><br><br></li>
 
        <li class="pat-li"> Nong Nooch Tropical Garden<br>
  <img class="patt-img" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0FpLQArYTOo/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="pat-img1"> 
     
    <p class="pattaya-p">
     Nong Nooch Garden is set in a 2.4sq.km. beautifully landscaped park and can easily make an all-day trip. The entire area is more like a theme park, with daily cultural shows, restaurants and accommodation as well as a vast area showcasing individually themed gardens. A leisurely stroll through the botanical park is like taking a journey around the world, through its many famous gardens, whether 17th-century French garden, Stonehenge, or European Renaissance garden. Equally fascinating are species-specific gardens, such as cactus and succulent plants, orchid nurseries, tropical palm gardens, bonsai and topiary garden.
    </p><br><br> </li>
  
  
  <li class="pat-li"> Pattaya Floating Market<br> 
  <img class="patt-img" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRBtPycM606Mv7wnSrXJWVzjCR0mlAmq8fnx6VQ6_KTMq6BnE0q6A" alt="pat-img2"> 
     
    <p class="pattaya-p">
     Covering an area of 100,000sqm, the Four Regions Floating Market is separated into four sections – each representing and selling items from the four major parts of Thailand (north, northeast, central and south). Expect to find many eateries, fruit stalls, souvenir shops and some art galleries. There is also a cultural show every afternoon. The 350 million baht market has over 114 shops and water vendors selling authentic Thai food, desserts and specialties from all over the kingdom. For a floating market experience, hire a man-powered boat to get around and discover the richness of the surrounding Thai architecture and riverside life. Typically, the boat is big enough for four people and can be hired for a small fee for around 30 minutes.
    </p><br><br></li>
  
  
  <li class="pat-li"> Tiffany Cabaret Show<br> 
  <img class="patt-img" src="https://image.kkday.com/image/get/w_1080%2Cc_fit/s1.kkday.com/product_17669/20170823100630_yzTXY/jpeg" alt="pat-img3"> 
     
    <p class="pattaya-p">
     Tiffany's Cabaret Show takes place in a grand theatre that, with its huge faux-marble lobby, manages to be almost as spectacular as the dazzling costumes. Performers make their entrances dressed in everything from long sweeping ball-gowns and plumes of feathers, to elaborate headdresses and skimpy polkadot swimwear. A breathless hour-long riot of sound, colour and light ensues; a show that spans the entire hemisphere through song, dance or skit. Scenes include a Bollywood musical take on the Indian Raj, a traditional Korean fan dance, homage to China's Imperial past and progress, Siam's history told through graceful Thai dance, Broadway show tunes, and slapstick burlesque.
